## Hello and Welcome

I will try my best to do at least one leet code problem everyday and post it here, you can look up the folder structure down below if you want! 

## Folder Structure

```src/ProblemName/Solution.java```

```src/ProblemName/explanation.md```

I can't guarantee that all of the problems will have an explanation mostly because I do not always have the time.

Most of the problems come from https://leetcode.com/
