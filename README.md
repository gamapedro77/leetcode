## Hello and Welcome

I will try my best to do at least one leet code problem everyday and post it here, you can look up the folder structure down below if you want! 

## Folder Structure

```src/problem-name/solution.java```

```src/problem-name/explanation.md```

I can't guarantee that all of the problems will have an explanation mostly because some of them are fairly simple and some of them you can find plenty of explanations online and sometimes I just do not have the time to explain it.
